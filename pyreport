Introduction for (project name).

The “project name” is built to help people and make their life easier in various ways related to their medication details,
our project will help them resolve most of their doubts / queries related to any medicinal drug, information on not only
about the drug but it can also give some important information about the makers/ manufacturers of the drug and their address. 
Usually all the data is uploaded by or filed by the respective pharma companies, the main aim is to educate users about 
the medicines which are available in the market today.

There may be situations where a person may not be able to visit a Doctor for drug consultation for many reasons
for e.g. the person may not have time to visit due to his/her tight schedule, didn't get a doctor's appointment
etc.

By sitting at home our users can search for any drug which is present in the market and can learn about it. 
No formal knowledge is required for the user while using our system.Our project has a very simple UI for the 
purpose of user friendliness of the page. The data which is present in  the database is provided by the many 
pharma companies who actually manufacture those medicines. We take utmost care not to fill inappropriate data 
into the database.

Inside the database we can not only add or delete data/ information but can also create admin accounts where 
an admin can be a representative of a pharma company who provides details to our project.Such admins have few 
rights and cannot access full database. We as project managers have full rights and we can add or remove users 
as per request.
